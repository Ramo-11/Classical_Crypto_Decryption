THE ENIGMA MACHINES WERE A SERIES OF ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ROTOR CIPHER MACHINES DEVELOPED AND USED 
IN THE EARLY TO MID TWENTIETH CENTURY TO PROTECT COMMERCIAL DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY COMMUNICATION ENIGMA WAS 
INVENTED BY THE GERMAN ENGINEER ARTHURS C HERB I US AT THE END OF WORLD WAR ONE EARLY MODELS WERE USED
COMMERCIALLY FROM THE EARLY NINETEEN TWENTIES AND ADOPTED BY MILITARY AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES OF
SEVERAL COUNTRIES MOST NOTABLY NAZI GERMANY BEFORE AND DURING WORLD WAR TWO SEVERAL
DIFFERENT ENIGMA MODELS WERE PRODUCED BUT THE GERMAN MILITARY MODELS ARE THE MOST COMMONLY RECOGNISED
HOWEVER JAPANESE AND ITALIAN MODELS HAVE BEEN USED GERMAN MILITARY MESSAGES ENCIPHERED
ON THE ENIGMA MACHINE WERE FIRST BROKEN BY THE POLISH CIPHER BUREAU BEGINNING IN DECEMBER NINETEEN THIRTY-TWO THIS
SUCCESS WAS A RESULT OF EFFORTS BY THREE POLISH CRYPTANALYSTS MARIAN RE JEW SKI JERZYR OZ YCK I AND HENRY KZY GAL SKI 
WORKING FOR POLISH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE RE JEW SKI REVERSE ENGINEERED THE DEVICE USING THEORETICAL MATHEMATICS AND MATERIALS UP 
PLIED BY FRENCH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE SUBSEQUENTLY THE THREE MATHEMATICIANS DESIGNED MECHANICAL DEVICES FOR BREAKING ENIGMA CIPHERS INCLUDING
THE CRYPTOLOGIC BOMB FROM NINETEEN THIRTY-EIGHT ONWARDS ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY WAS REPEATEDLY ADDED TO THE ENIGMA MACHINES MAKING DECRYPTION MORE DIFFICULT AND REQUIRING FURTHER EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL MORE THAN THE POLES COULD READILY PRODUCE ON TWENTY-SIX AND TWENTYSEVEN JULY NINETEEN THIRTY-NINE IN PYRY NEAR WARSAW THE POLES INITIATED FRENCH AND BRITISH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVES INTO THEIR ENIGMA DECRYPTION TECHNIQUES AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDING ZY GAL SKI SHEETS AND THE CRYPTOLOGIC BOMB AND PROMISED EACH DE LEG AT IONA POLISH RECONSTRUCTED ENIGMA THE DEMONSTRATION REPRESENTED A VITAL BASIS FORTH ELATER BRITISH CONTINUATION AND EFFORT DURING THE WAR BRITISH CRYPTOLOGISTS DECRYPTED AVAST NUMBER OF MESSAGES ENCIPHERED ON ENIGMA ALAN TURING WAS THE CENTRAL FORCE IN BREAKING THE ENIGMA THE INTELLIGENCE GLEANED FROM THIS SOURCE CODENAMED ULTRA BY THE BRITISH WAS A SUBSTANTIAL AID TO THE ALLIED WAR EFFORT THOUGH ENIGMA HAD SOME CRYPTOGRAPHIC WEAKNESSES IN PRACTICE IT WAS GERMAN PROCEDURAL FLAWS OPERATOR MISTAKES FAILURE TO SYSTEMATICALLY INTRODUCE CHANGES IN ENCIPHER MEN T PROCEDURES AN DALLIED CAPTURE OF KEY TABLES AND HARDWARE THAT DURING THE WAR ENABLED ALLIED CRYPTOLOGISTS TO SUCCEED AND TURNED THE TIDE IN THE ALLIES FAV OR THE END
